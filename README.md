# PREMIUM
SafeCloud route-aware channels. The SafeCloud project developed security solutions intended to be secure even against powerful, motivated and well-funded adversaries.


## Getting Started
For this guide we will need 5 virtual machines to simulate 5 distributed components of MACHETE: a sender, a receiver, a multipath manager to store information about the network and two overlay nodes to forward traffic through different routes. The virtual machines will be executed in Virtual Box and they all use the following virtual disk.


### Prerequisites

 * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

### Installing

The following instructions should be followed using the virtual machines previously created. A guide that describes how to set the virtual machines can be found [here](doc/VIRTUALBOX-GUIDE.md).

This virtual image has MACHETEâ€™s dependencies but still misses Darshana dependencies. So we have to install them by running:

```
$ cd MACHETE/install 
$ sh install_darshana_dependencies.sh

```
Now, we need to have DepSpacito, MACHETE and Darshana repositories together in your working directory:

```
_/home
 |-- DepSpacito
 |-- MACHETE
 |-- Darshana 
```


MPM - Multipath Manager
Start the virtual machine MACHETE-MPM. 
The MultiPath Manager is a coordination service called DepSpace. To start DepSpace open a terminal and go to the DepSpacito folder:

```
$ cd DepSpacito
$ su
$ git pull
$ sh build.sh
$ sh run.sh
```

The build.sh will output the IP address of the machine. Take note of this IP address since it will be required by every component of MACHETE.
Overlay Nodes
Now let us start two overlay nodes. To do so repeat the following steps twice, first for MACHETE-ON-1 and second for MACHETE-ON-2.

```
$ su
$ cd MACHETE
$ git pull
$ cd SCNodeCode 
$ sh build.sh <MPM_IP_ADDRESS>
```

Then for MACHETE-ON-1 execute:
```
$ sh run1.sh
```

And for MACHETE-ON-2 execute:
```
$ sh run2.sh
```

Receiver
Start the receiver Virtual Machine. Open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```
$ su
$ cd MACHETE
$ git pull
$ cd SCMultipath
$ sh build.sh <MPM_IP_ADDRESS>
$ sh run-receiver.sh
```

In a different terminal window execute:
```
$ hostname -I
```

This will output the IP address of the receiver which will be required by the sender. Take note of the receiver address.
Sender
Start the sender Virtual Machine. Open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```
$ su
$ cd MACHETE
$ git pull
$ cd SCMultipath
$ sh build.sh <MPM_IP_ADDRESS>
$ sh run-sender.sh <RECEIVER_IP_ADDRESS> <FILE_PATH_TO_SEND>
```

The file size should be greater than 1MB, since below this value it is difficult for MACHETE to successfully break the file into parts. A good file to send is an image file, this way we can see the image in the receiver VM.
If everything was correctly configured, the file should be transmitted from the sender to the receiver, with traffic going through two different overlay nodes. It is possible to use a traffic analysis tool, such as bmon or tcpdump, to visualize data being sent from sender to receiver.
To visualize the traffic execute one of the following commands:

```
$ tcpdump -i eth# -Q out 
```
where # is the number of the network interface

or

```
$ bmon
```
